    //!
    //! \brief The qt_audio_output class can be used for easily configurable audio streaming.
    //!
    //! This class is based on Qt's QAudioOutput.
    //! It can be configured in several ways (for details see the respective methods):
    //! - audio volume: set_volume()
    //! - audio data sampling rate: set_input_sampling_rate().
    //! - audio data resampling quality: set_resampling_quality()
    //! - audio latency: set_latency()
    //! - audio device: set_output()
    //! - audio output format: set_output()
    //!
    //! Before any audio streaming is possible, set_output() must be called at least once.
    //! The audio stream must be kept alive by regular stream_audio_data() calls.
    //! The underlying QAudioOutput object is used in "push mode" (by not specifying any
    //! QIODevice when calling QAudioOutput::start()).
    //!
    //! Hints regarding QAudioOutput:
    //! - When trying "pull mode" (by using a custom QIODevice for buffering audio data),
    //! there were frequent noticable audio lags caused by buffer underflows.
    //! Apparently some of the timer events used for streaming audio data in "pull mode"
    //! were massively delayed.
    //! - QAudioOutput::setVolume() did not work very well on Windows. Calling this method
    //! sometimes did not work at all and at other times caused CPU load spikes and audio
    //! lags. That's why we use our own volume control: downsampler::set_volume().
    //!

        //! \brief Use the specified audio device and audio format for audio streaming.

        //! This method expects, that:
        //! - the specified format is supported by the specified device
        //! - the specified format's channel count is 2
        //! - the specified format's sample size is 16 bits
        //! - the specified format's codec is "audio/pcm"
        //! - the specified format's sample type is QAudioFormat::SignedInt
        //! - the specified format's sample rate is greater than 1
        //!
        //! The root cause of these expectations is that we are streaming audio data
        //! in form of {@link pcm_frame}s.
        //! The behaviour when specifying parameters that do not meet these expectations
        //! is undefined.
        //!
        //! Note that the specified format's sample rate can be varied since
        //! qt_audio_output is capable of resampling the audio data to be
        //! streamed.
        //!
        //! \param device_info A QAudioDeviceInfo for audio output device to use.
        //! \param format A QAudioFormat for the audio output format to use.

        //! some audible crack noise), streaming will be paused until the intermediate
        //! buffer is filled completely.
        //! By enforcing the audio latency in that way the probability of multiple
        //! concurrent buffer underflows is reduced.
